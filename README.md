# android-maze-game
This project is a 3D maze game that I created for my CSCI 301 Software Development class. It was initially developed as a Java application in Eclipse but then changed into an Android application using Android Studio. I was initially given code refactored by my CSCI 301 professor. The code came from Maze.java by Paul Falstad, www.falstad.com, Copyright (C) 1998, all rights reserved. Paul Falstad granted permission to modify and use code for teaching purposes. I worked off of this code to create this android app. 

I have added screenshots of what the app looks like in the screenshots folder. I used a minecraft theme for my app.
